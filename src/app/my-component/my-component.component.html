<h1>This is "MyComponent"</h1>
<h2>Remember: the ngOnChanges() lifecycle hook is only fired when a component's parent is changed</h2>
<p>
	In our case, the parent component is MyComponent, which has the property 'crimeInput'. This is then
	read by the child component 'reader'. If 'reader' sees crimeInput has changed, then the event is fired.
</p>

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="crimeInput" />

<app-reader readerInput="{{crimeInput}}"></app-reader>
